## üìù **REALISTIC DATA EXAMPLES**

### **Sample Requirements**

**High Priority - Security:**
```json
{
  "name": "Patient Data Encryption at Rest",
  "description": "All patient genomic data must be encrypted using AES-256 when stored in databases or file systems",
  "priority": "critical",
  "status": "approved",
  "format": "incose",
  "level": "system",
  "external_id": "SEC-001"
}
```

**Medium Priority - Functional:**
```json
{
  "name": "Variant Calling Pipeline Integration",
  "description": "System shall integrate GATK variant calling pipeline with configurable parameters for sensitivity vs specificity",
  "priority": "high",
  "status": "active",
  "format": "incose",
  "level": "component",
  "external_id": "GEN-015"
}
```

## üîÑ **DEMO WORKFLOW SCRIPT**

### **Step 1: Setup**
1. Authenticate with MCP
2. Check for Phenotype org (or create Argis-Org)
3. Set workspace context

### **Step 2: Create Projects**
```javascript
for each project in [5 projects]:
  - Create project with workflow_tool
  - Add team members (relationships)
  - Create initial documents
```

### **Step 3: Populate Requirements**
```javascript
for each document:
  - Create 8-12 requirements
  - Vary priority (30% high, 50% medium, 20% low)
  - Vary status (70% active, 20% approved, 10% draft)
  - Add realistic descriptions
```

### **Step 4: Add Tests & Properties**
```javascript
- Create test cases linked to requirements
- Add custom properties for configuration
```

### **Step 5: Verification**
```javascript
- Run aggregate query (should show ~200 entities)
- Test search across all types
- Verify relationships
```
